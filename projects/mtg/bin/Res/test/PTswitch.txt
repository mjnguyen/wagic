#Testing PT Switch. Windreaver and Screaming Fury... Layer 7e
#A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the
#creature’s power and toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. A new effect gives
#the creature +5/+0. Its “unswitched” power and toughness would be 6/4, so its actual
#power and toughness is 4/6.
