#Testing Turn to Frog to Serra Angel with Crusade in play.
#M15 uses base power template, so setting the power/toughness.
#only affects the base or original power/toughness.
#Turn to Frog makes Serra Angel a 1/1 blue frog... latest pull
#request from GIT fixes the issue of Serra Angel dying
#from crusade because of invalid reduction of P/T :)
#
#First attack is 1/1 blue Serra Angel unaffected by Crusade
#Second attack is 5/5 Serra Angel affected by Crusade :)
