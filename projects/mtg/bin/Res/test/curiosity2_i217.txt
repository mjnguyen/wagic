#2/1/2007	You draw one card each time the enchanted creature damages the opponent. This is not one card per point of damage.
#2/1/2007	If put on your opponent's creature, you do not draw a card when that creature damages you. The creature has to damage your opponent in order to have this work.
#2/1/2007	Drawing a card is optional. If you forget, you can't go back later and do it, even if it is something you normally do.
